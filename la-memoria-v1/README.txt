"LA MEMORIA Y EL OLVIDO" (2011) by Ángel Faraldo, based on an original textwork by Tanja Smit


DESCRIPTION

"La memoria y el olvido" is an instrument/installation based on the graphic work 'La memoria', by Dutch artist Tanja Smit.

The work displays a picture of the above mentioned piece on a computer screen, which can be freely navigated with the aid of a mouse by the user (be this a visitor or a performer presenting a particular version of it), rendering into sound her or his own journey through the text. The work is therefore suitable to be presented as an interactive installation and as a piece played simultaneously by a group of performers creating overlapping layers of sound.

Tanja Smit has been making art on newspapers, magazines, books, etc. for more than 20 years. In her own words, her "textworks explore and expose language in its printed form. They consist of simple, repetitive manual interventions in already existing printed texts, which vary from newspaper- and magazine articles to whole books [...] exploring the hidden structures and meanings of the text. They are meditations on language, obsession, music, power, play, design, structure and beauty. Some have served as graphic scores for musical performance and others have been especially made for that purpose, but in general they are autonomous works."

INSTALL

"La memoria y el olvido" is written in Pd/Gem, so you need to download these in order to run the piece. The easiest way is to download Pd-extended 0.42.5 from <http://puredata.info/community/projects/software/pd-extended>, which includes all the external libraries needed.

After download, follow the instructions to install, then open the file "laMemoria.pd" inside the folder with the same name, and follow the instructions on screen. Keep all the content of the folder together, otherwise the program will not work.


DISCLAIMER

Although the piece should work on any operative system where Pd can run, I have only tested it on a Mac with OS X. If you experience problems running on different OS, please contact me at <angelfaraldo@gmail.com>

Enjoy.
